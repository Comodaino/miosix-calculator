# Scientific Calculator using Miosix
This project is for the embedded system course @polimi

It uses Lex and Bison to parse the input from serial, then outputs the result both in serial and on a LCD display.

Currently it's made for a STM32F4 microprocessor, but other various miosix capable microprocessor can run it. 
Remember to change the config according to the miosix wiki in case of a different board
