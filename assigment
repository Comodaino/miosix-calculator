Scientific Calculator with Miosix
The goal of the project is to develop a scientific calculator. Requirements:
Target STM32F4 chip (provided with a STM324-discovery board)
Interface with a 20x2 LCD character display (provided)
Input using the RS232 serial (no keypad for simplicity)
The calculator engine should support arbitrary infix expressions (with parenthesis for example) and at least the following functions: sin, cos, tan, x^2, x^3, y^x, 10^x, e^x, square root, third root, arbitrary root, logarithm in base 10, natural logarithm, logarithm in base 2, factorial.
More complicated and/or well made implementations of each game will result in better scores (to our discretion).
